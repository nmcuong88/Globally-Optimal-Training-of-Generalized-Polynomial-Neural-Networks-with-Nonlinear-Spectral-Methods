Guidelines:  
Please see the following files to run our experiments  
	1. main_NLSM.m: testing our Nonlinear Spectral Methods  
	2. main_ReLU1.m: testing one-hidden-layer ReLU nets by Batch-SGD  
	3. main_ReLU2.m: testing two-hidden-layer ReLU nets by Batch-SGD  

In all experiments, we use UCI-datasets obtained from:
